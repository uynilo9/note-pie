# ðŸ¥§ - The Note-pie modern MD notes app

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uynilo9/note-pie/main/docs/preview.png)

## âœ¨ Intro

A tiny and modern Markdown notes app written in Vue and TypeScript, which aims to get me something to do in holiday.

Feel free to create an issue or a PR to make this project even better, I really appreciate that because I'm such a lazy homebody.

Also, I'm supposed to make some (lots of) mistakes in the codes. Please let me know or help me fix and correct once you find one.
